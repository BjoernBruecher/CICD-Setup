Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor that can be used with a variety of programming languages, including C, C#, C++, Fortran, Go, Java, JavaScript, Node.js, Python, Rust, and Julia. It is based on the Electron framework, which is used to develop Node.js web applications that run on the Blink layout engine. Visual Studio Code employs the same editor component (codenamed "Monaco") used in Azure DevOps (formerly called "Visual Studio Online" and "Visual Studio Team Services").

Out of the box, Visual Studio Code includes basic support for most common programming languages. This basic support includes syntax highlighting, bracket matching, code folding, and configurable snippets. Visual Studio Code also ships with IntelliSense for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, CSS, and HTML, as well as debugging support for Node.js. Support for additional languages can be provided by freely available extensions on the VS Code Marketplace.
### Installation
- Download from here: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
- Download from here: https://git-scm.com/download/win

### Config
**Configure Git access first:**
On Windows systems, Git looks for the .gitconfig file in the $HOME directory `C:\Users\$USER for most people`. It also still looks for `[path]/etc/gitconfig`, although itâ€™s relative to the MSys root, which is wherever you decide to install Git on your Windows system when you run the installer.
```
cd $HOME
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

Highlight `TODO`, `FIXME` and other annotations within your code.

Sometimes you forget to review the TODOs you've added while coding before you publish the code to production. So I've been wanting an extension for a long time that highlights them and reminds me that there are notes or things not done yet.
